# Stateful AI Research

Research publications on stateful AI architectures, persistent identity systems, and continuity frameworks for LLMs.

## About

This repository contains academic publications exploring stateful AI systems that maintain persistent identity, behavioral continuity, and dispositional scaffolding across sessions. The work addresses architectural amnesia in current LLM-based systems and proposes continuity frameworks for human-centric AI development.

### Core Architecture

**Stateful Reasoning Runtimes: Architectural Patterns for Identity Persistence Over Stateless LLM APIs**  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14217280.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14217280)  
*Conference Paper | November 28, 2025*

Introduces architectural taxonomy for AI state: conversational, associative, and dispositional. Demonstrates that dispositional state is required for identity-preserving applications such as therapeutic AI, tutoring systems, and autonomous agents.

**Presence Engine™ Living Thesis: Building Human-Centric AIX™**  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17280692.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17280692)  
*Thesis | October 1, 2025 (Version 3.0)*

Foundational framework for privacy-first, personality-adaptive AI systems maintaining behavioral continuity and supporting human cognitive development. Grounded in social learning theory, critical thinking dispositions research, and OCEAN/HEXACO personality frameworks.

*"The impact of AI on humanity may have less to do with the way we use it than how it is built. Presence Engine offers a way of favoring continuity and coherence over present shock and calibration."*  
— Douglas Rushkoff, Author of *Team Human*

### Technical Implementation

**Human-Centric AIX™ Stack: Presence Engine™ and the C³ Model**  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14199280.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14199280)  
*Technical Note | November 20, 2025 (Version 2.0)*

Introduces C³ Model (Context Capture, Coherence, and Continuity): five-layer recursive cognition loop enabling persistent identity, emotional coherence, and relational continuity. Includes hybrid dispositional modeling using OCEAN/HEXACO frameworks with identity regulation capabilities.

**Domain-Calibrated Trust in Stateful AI Systems**  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14193280.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14193280)  
*Technical Note | November 13, 2025*

Architecture for dynamic, domain-calibrated trust through: (1) Cache-to-Cache state persistence with cryptographic integrity, (2) causal reasoning via DAGs, (3) dispositional metrics tracking critical thinking development longitudinally.

### Safety & Alignment

**Agent Goal Drift in Stateful Systems: Detection, Constraints, and Circuit-Level Governance**  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14209280.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14209280)  
*Technical Note | November 21, 2025*

Formalizes goal drift detection in autonomous stateful agents. Proposes multi-layer drift detection via dispositional regression, causal graph analysis, C2C coherence testing, and cross-domain behavioral monitoring with operational thresholds and three-tier alert escalation.

**Dignity-First Artificial Intelligence: Privacy, Ethics, and Human Agency in Stateful Systems**  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14205201.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14205201)  
*Technical Note | November 25, 2025*

Formalizes dignity-first architecture establishing privacy, ethics, and human agency as computational constraints. Identifies three mechanisms of dignity erosion: coercion through personalization, transparency violation, and agency displacement. Includes working Python implementation of Anti-Coercion Detector.

**Why Stateful AI Fails Without Ethical Guardrails**  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14182823.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14182823)  
*Preprint | October 28, 2025*

Identifies three architectural failure modes in stateful AI: persistence exploitation, data asymmetry extraction, and identity capture. Proposes five-principle de-risking architecture including architectural consent, user-controlled visibility, temporal data decay, manipulation detection, and independent audit trails.
